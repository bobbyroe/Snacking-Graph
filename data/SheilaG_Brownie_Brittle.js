This is why California recently required foods containing caramel color to be labeled as potential cancer-causing agents.  \n\nBut you won't see this warning label any time soon - manufacturers simply reduced the use of caramel color enough that the labeling requirements no longer applied.\n\nCaramel color varies slightly between products - when in beer, sauces or baked goods it has just ammonia and when used in soft drinks, it has both sulfites and ammonia.  Neither one is a \"good\" option.\n\nBottom line: Choose something else, less controversial."
